2.1.7 (2003-05-15)
==================


New Features:
- DOM documents can now share a common name pool
- The CXMLWriter class now uses the CXMLWriter2 class internally
- Improved robustness of DOM event handling when the DOM document is
  modified in an event handler
- The VC++ project files include support for Unicode and DLL builds
  
  
Bugfixes:
- added a missing exception message
- DOM: fixed a dangling pointer problem when a node is released and 
  there are still references to its child nodes
- SAX: fixed a bug in CAttributes::GetIndex


2.1.3 (2002-09-27)
==================


Bugfixes:
- added missing getElementByNameNS() and ~CDeclHandler() methods
- changed assertion() macro to csl_assert(); added csl_check_ptr()
  and csl_precondition() macros.


2.1.2 (2002-04-05)
==================


Bugfixes:
- fixed a bug in DOMBuilder constructor
- fixed a compile error in SAX2Parser.cpp when compiling in UNICODE mode


2.1.1 (2002-02-08)
==================


Bugfixes:
- performance improvements in DOMBuilder
- reduced DOM memory footprint
- XMLWriter2 now writes empty elements the way they are meant to be written


2.1.0 (2002-01-03)
==================


New Features:
- added support for ISO 8859-1 encoding in DOM


2.0.2 (2001-10-24)
==================


Bugfixes:
- removed a problematic recursion in ContainerNode destructor.
- fixed namespaces related bugs in XMLWriter2


2.0.1 (2001-08-14)
==================


New Features:
- performance improvements in XMLWriter2
- fixed a bug with namespace support (default namespaces were
  handled incorrectly) in XMLWriter2
- fixed VC++ project file
- updated samples


2.0.0 (2001-08-11)
==================


New Features:
- improved memory management
  WARNING: The rules for duplicate()/release() have changed. See DOMObject.h.
- improved performance & stability
- fixed DOMBuilder namespace handling (broken in b1)


2.0.0b1 (2001-06-06)
====================


New Features:
- full SAX2 support
- complete rewrite of DOM parser with support for DOM level 2
- improved XML Writer


1.7.3 (2001-02-02)
==================


New Features:
- Greatly improved performance when parsing attribute lists
  (re-implemented CAttributeListImp)


1.7.2 (2001-01-15)
==================


Bugfixes:
- fixed a bug in CXMLContainer::InsertChildBefore()


1.7.1 (2000-11-22)
==================


Bugfixes:
- CXMLWriter wrote bad character entity references for characters > ASCII 126.
- Arguments to CSAXParserBase::HandleStartNamespace() and HandleEndNamespace() can be NULL.
  This is now properly checked for before constructing an XMLString from them.


1.7.0 (2000-10-06)
==================


New Features:
- Classes CSAXDocumentParser and CSAXDOMParser for serializing
  an XML document into SAX events.
- Class CDOMWriter for serializing a DOM tree into an XML stream.
- Improved CXMLWriter, now supports comments, CDATA sections,
  pretty printing and better error checking.
- New platforms supported
- Updated to expat 1.2


Bugfixes:
- CXMLParserBase: expat's XML_Parse function is now correctly
  called with isFinal==1 at the end of the input stream. This ensures
  that malformed XML streams (i.e. missing end tags) result in
  an exception.
- Missing const qualifiers added to some methods.


Misc:
- Changed the names of the SAX parser's proprietary SAX2 properties to
  "http://cpointc.com/xml/parser/DocumentBase" and
  "http://cpointc.com/xml/parser/DefaultHandler"


1.6.6 (2000-08-22)
==================


New Features:
- Class and method names of the DOM interface are now
  according to the W3C DOM specification.
- added type DOMString, which is an alias for XMLString
- Building without CenterPoint/Base is now the
  default behaviour
- moved some code out of DOMBuilder.cpp into new file
  DOMImpl.cpp
- Added sample code to build a DOM document from scratch
  to DOMTest.cpp
  

Bugfixes:
- Building a DOM document "from scratch" now works
  (previously, due to a wrong precondition, it was not
  possible to attach a document element to a document).


1.6.5 (2000-08-09)
==================


New Features:
- Standalone version compiles without CenterPoint/Base
  (for open source release).
  

Bugfixes:
- Fixed some inconsistencies with exception codes and exception
  messages.
  

1.6.4 (2000-07-21)
==================


New Features:
- Support for Unix (HP-UX and Linux)
  

1.6.3 (2000-06-19)
==================


New Features:
- Replaced CXMLException::GetErrorText() with GetStaticErrorText()
- Moved the implementation of CSAXException (and subclasses) and
  CDOMException methods out of the header files.
  

1.6.2 (2000-06-07)
==================


New Features:
- CXMLWriter::Characters() now writes hexadecimal character references
  for characters < 32 or > 126.


1.6.1 (2000-05-31)
==================


New Features:
- Added documentation
- CXMLWriter: new method DataElement()
- CXMLDocument: element and attribute names are stored in a string
  pool. This should reduce memory footprint of document trees built
  from large XML files.
  

New Classes:
- CXMLStringPool


1.6.0 (2000-05-26)
==================


New Features:
- XMLWriter: new methods StartFragment/EndFragment
- improved exception handling
