Instructions for building CenterPoint XML
=========================================

To use the supplied Makefile, you will also need GNU Make,
as the Makefile probably won't work with other make's.

If you're not compiling with gcc/g++, edit the Makefile
as appropriate.

Running make with the supplied Makefile will build two
libraries in the XML/lib directory: libcslxml.a (the
release version) and libcslxmld.a (the debug version).
You can also build a shared library if you set the
compiler and linker options accordingly.

To build the supplied samples, cd to the samples directory,
edit the Makefile if necessary and run it.

For users of VC++ 6.0, project and workspace files are
included.
