======================================================

This directory contains the source code for programs in the set 
of Humdrum programs which are compiled from C++ programs.
Compiled versions of these programs for various operating systems
are available with documentation from the website:
   http://extras.humdrum.org

The Humdrum Extras set of programs are a subset of programs
found in the Museinfo set:
  http://museinfo.sapp.org
Humdrum Extras is a set of the more useful Humdrum processing
programs available from the Museinfo set.

The most recent version of the Humdrum Extra program set is
available for download from the webpage:
   http://extras.humdrum.org/download

In linux, you can download the source files with one of the following
command:
   wget http://extras.humdrum.org/download/humextra.tgz
and uncompress the GUN-zipped tar file with the command:
   tar xvzf humextra.tgz

To compile the Humdrum Extra programs found in this directory
structure, type the following commands:
   cd humextra		# if not already in the humextra base directory
   make library
   make programs

To compile only a single program, such as barnum, you would
type the following commands:
   make library
   make barnum

If you write your own programs, you can place them in the
directory humextra/src-programs and then compile them in
a manner similar to compiling single programs described above.

Compiled programs are written to the humextra/bin directory.
